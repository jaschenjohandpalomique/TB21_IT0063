                        <p class="desc">Pikachu is a yellow, mouse-like creature with electrical abilities. It is a major character in the Pokémon franchise, serving as its mascot. These visual features are reinforced by Pikachu personality and powers. He is loyal to Ash, brave in front of countless challenges and conveys emotions openly through facial expressions, noises and constant affirmation of who he is: “Pika, Pika, Pikachu! Pikachu is not only able to dodge most attacks while also dishing them out at such a powerful level of strength, but he's also able to take attacks few, if any, other Pikachu could take head-on.”  </p>

When the headache gets too bad, its brain cells awaken, allowing it to use strong psychic powers. Psyduck is classified in-game as a Water-type Pokémon. Despite being generally shown as dimwitted and oblivious, when its headache gets bad enough, it has been shown to use phenomenally powerful Psychic-type moves which far exceed its normal ability. Psyduck is strong against Ground, Rock, Fire type Pokémon and resistant to Steel, Fire, Water, Ice type Pokémon in a battle.”  </p>
